# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game repository! This is a simple dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Game

Pig Game, also known as Pass the Pigs, is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling a single die to accumulate points. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score threshold, typically 100 points.

## How to Play

1. The game is played by two players, taking turns to roll a single die.
2. On each turn, a player rolls the die and accumulates points based on the number rolled:
    - If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
    - If a player rolls any other number, that number is added to their current score for the turn.
3. A player can choose to "hold" their current score, adding it to their total score for the game and ending their turn.
4. The first player to reach the predefined score threshold (100 points) wins the game.

## Features
